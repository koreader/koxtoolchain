# KOReader Cross Compile ToolChains

Build scripts to help generate cross ToolChains for various platforms supported by KOReader.


## Dependencies

* git
* ncurses
* gperf
* help2man
* bison
* texinfo
* flex
* gawk
* unzip

## For Arch users:
```bash
sudo pacman -S base-devel curl git gperf help2man unzip wget
```

## For Debian/Ubuntu users:

```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential autoconf automake bison flex gawk libtool libtool-bin libncurses-dev curl file git gperf help2man texinfo unzip wget
```

## Usage

The build script takes a platform name as its first argument.
For example, to build a cross toolchain for legacy non-touch kindle devices, type:

```
./gen-tc.sh kindle
```

You can use `./gen-tc.sh -h` to get a list of supported platforms (some of which may not have a matching KOReader target, either because a port was never finished (e.g., `bookeen`), or they're just minor variants for evolving platforms where KOReader prefers to keep backwards compatibility intact (e.g., `kobov4`)).

After the build is finished, you should be able to find your cross ToolChains under the `~/x-tools` directory.

The [reference script](/refs/x-compile.sh) can be used to automatically setup a cross-compilation environment (`PATH`, `*FLAGS` & all that jazz), as mentioned at the end of a TC build.  
For example, for a Kobo TC:
```shell
source refs/x-compile.sh kobo env
```

## Container image

You can also use a container with the precompiled toolchain. Pull the relevant image from the [GitHub Container Registry](https://ghcr.io/koreader/koxtoolchain). Alternatively, build the image locally using the [source script](./buildah-koxtoolchain.sh) (requires [Buildah](https://buildah.io/), run `./buildah-koxtoolchain.sh -h` for instructions).

To use the containerized toolchain (for example, Kobo):

```bash
podman pull ghcr.io/koreader/koxtoolchain:kobo-latest
podman run --rm -it -v <source_folder>:/home/kox/build koxtoolchain:kobo-latest
  
kox@containerID$ <build_command>
```

For systems with SELinux enforcing (ex. Fedora), use this launch command instead:

```bash
podman run --rm -it -v <source_folder>:/home/kox/build:z koxtoolchain:kobo-latest
```

## Notes

Due to a whole lot of legacy baggage, the names of the various Kindle TCs may be slightly confusing (especially compared to KOReader's target names), so, let's disambiguate that:

|     TC    |       Supported Devices       |     Target    |
|:---------:|:-----------------------------:|:-------------:|
|   kindle  |      Kindle 2, DX, DXg, 3     | kindle-legacy |
|  kindle5  |      Kindle 4, Touch, PW1     |     kindle    |
| kindlepw2 | Kindle PW2 & everything since |   kindlepw2   |
|  kindlehf |   Any Kindle on FW >= 5.16.3  |    kindlehf   |

No such worries on Kobo & Cervantes, though ;).  

The nickel TC is a Kobo variant that mimics Kobo's own TC (as of FW >= 4.6). It is *not* recommended for general purpose stuff, only use it if you have a specific need for it (which should essentially be limited to working with Kobo's nickel, or Kobo's kernels).

The kobov5 TC is specifically tailored for Kobo & Tolino devices running on FW 5.x. Since that FW implies packaging differences compared to earlier iterations, it does warrant a dedicated KOReader target. (It also targets a *much* more recent glibc version).

The pocketbook TC aims for maximum backward compatibility while still keeping inkview support.

The remarkable TC aims for FW >= 2.x compatibility.

The bookeen TC has only been tested on AWA13 devices, but *should* theoretically handle OMAP3611 ones, too.

## Known Issues

Only actively tested on Linux hosts.  
May work on macOS with some efforts, if you follow crosstool-ng's recommendations on the subject. This is only bound to get worse.  
May work on Windows with even more efforts, but I wouldn't bother.  
When in doubt, use a Debian VM.
