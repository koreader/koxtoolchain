		## But, basically, if you want to build a Kernel, backport https://github.com/mirrors/linux/commit/8428e84d42179c2a00f5f6450866e70d802d1d05 [it's not in FW 2.5.8/3.4/4.1.0/5.1.2],
		## or build your Kernel with -mno-unaligned-access
		## You might also want to backport https://github.com/mirrors/linux/commit/088c01f1e39dbe93a13e0b00f4532ed8b79d35f4 if you intend to roll your own Kernel.
		## For those interested, basically, if your kernel has this: https://github.com/mirrors/linux/commit/baa745a3378046ca1c5477495df6ccbec7690428 then you're safe in userland.
		## (That's the commit merged in 2.6.28 that the GCC docs refer to).
		## It's in FW 3.x/4.x/5.x, so we're good on *some* Kindles. However, it's *NOT* in FW 2.x, and the trap handler defaults to ignoring unaligned access faults.
		## I haven't seen any *actual* issues yet, but the counter does increment...
		## So, to be on the safe side, let's use -mno-unaligned-access on the K3 TC, to avoid going kablooey in weird & interesting ways on FW 2.x... ;)
		## And again, if you roll your own kernel with this TC, this may also be of interest to you: https://bugs.launchpad.net/linaro-toolchain-binaries/+bug/1186218/comments/7
